# 311-service-requests-term-project
Created by Derek Dung, Frank CENTENO, Michael Montano, RYAN AAZAM, Andrew MEJIA. The research attempts to uncover if there is a significant difference between service request types and the time it takes to render services. Usage of HADOOP and HIVEQL is used to process data from 311 service center for years 2013 through 2022 for the City of Los Angeles. HiveQL is used to format the data into tables and query the information. The data is exported into Microsoft Excel to create interactive maps showing service requests by geographic location. In addition, Excel graphs and charts show request types and wait times.
